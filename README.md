# Pomodoro Study Technique Timer
A customizable Pomodoro study timer that notifies you via Windows toast notifications when to start and stop working.

NOTE: Malwarebytes and potentially some other anti-malware/anti-virus software will flag the executable. It's perfectly safe- if you really don't trust the release, you can bundle the code manually with pyinstaller.
